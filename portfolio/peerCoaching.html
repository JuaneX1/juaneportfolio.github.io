            <p>
                One of the most meaningful experiences I have had in UCF so far, is being a peer coach.
                Through this program, we are able to help transfer students have a smooth transition from community
                college to a bigger university. This experience has allowed me to grow personally and professionally, as
                well as meeting wonderful people who have a passion for what they do. It is through this program that I 
                believe I have made an impact in the community.
