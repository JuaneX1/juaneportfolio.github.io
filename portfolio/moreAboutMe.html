            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <p>
                During my time in college, I have been able to build great skills in different fields of 
                computer science; over the years, I learned programming in Python, Java, and C. I have 
                also built real world experiences through hackathon projects where I collaborated with 
                many great engineers, currently looking to enroll in an accelerated BS to MS program, 
                I'm commited to advancing my abilities and career. <br>
            </p>
            <h2>My Personal Statement</h2><br>
            <p>
                As a dedicated Computer Science major at the University of Central Florida, my academic journey has been characterized 
                by a relentless pursuit of excellence both within and beyond the classroom. Through coursework and extracurricular 
                involvement, I have honed my skills, fostered meaningful connections, and set my sights on becoming the best Software Engineer I can be.
                <br><br>

                Within the realm of academia, I have eagerly embraced the challenges of my Computer Science curriculum. The dynamic courses
                have not only equipped me with a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and programming languages but have also fueled my 
                passion for tackling complex problems. My coursework has been a crucible, forging my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilitiesâ€”the very 
                core of a successful Software Engineer.
                <br><br>

                Complementing my academic endeavors, I am an active member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). 
                Engaging with SHPE has provided me with a platform to connect with like-minded peers and professionals, fostering an environment 
                where diversity and innovation thrive. This community has been instrumental in broadening my perspective, exposing me to different 
                facets of the tech industry.

                Beyond the scope of my major, I serve as a peer coach at the Transfer Center, a role that has allowed me to 
                share my experiences, offer guidance, and support fellow students in navigating the challenges of transitioning to a new academic 
                environment. This role has cultivated my interpersonal and leadership skills, as well as reinforced my belief in the power of mentorship and 
                community.
                <br><br>

                Looking forward, my goal is to become the best Software Engineer possible. I am deeply committed to continuous learning, staying abreast of 
                emerging technologies, and contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of software development. I am drawn to the field not only
                for its intellectual challenges but also for its capacity to create solutions that impact individuals and communities.
