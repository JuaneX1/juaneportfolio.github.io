                During my time in college, I have been able to build great skills in different fields of 
                computer science; over the years, I learned programming in Python, Java, and C. I have 
                also built real world experiences through hackathon projects where I collaborated with 
                many great engineers, currently looking to enroll in an accelerated BS to MS program, 
                I'm commited to advancing my abilities and career. <br><br>

                I was born in Bogota, Colombia. I moved to the United States when I was 16 years old, and completed
                my high school education in West Palm Beach, Florida; where I learned English as my second language.
                I graduated high school in the midst of 2020, when our world changed drastically due to the pandemic.
                I then started my college journey in Palm Beach State College, where I started as an undecided major;
                since I was always interested in solving logic puzzles such as rubik's cubes, I decided to take an intro
                to coding class, which is where I found my passion for programming, and then decided I would study computer
                science. <br><br>

                My hobbies are videogames, boxing, basketball and weightlifting; I decided to start my fitness journey a few 
                years ago, and fell in love with it.
