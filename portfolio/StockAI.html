            <p>
                During the "KnightHacks 2023" Hackathon, I led the development of StockAI, a machine learning model that utilizes
                the Random Forests model from the Scikit-Learn library, this was coded in python, as well as the GUI. The model uses
                real time data from the Yahoo Finance API, then retrieves the most relevant data for the model, and trains it in real time
                to give the user accurate predictions; another features also includes a precision score, as well as accurate predictions for
                the upcoming weeks.<br><br>
